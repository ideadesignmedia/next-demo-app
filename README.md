Create a webapp using NextJS that does the following:
The main page list the names of users, which come from an API call to a NextJS API route.
The data for the users can be seeded from mock data, files, or any other mock. A database is not necessary.
The user can click a user to go to a new page which shows that user's detailed profile.
The profile information should come from API endpoints that are served from the NextJS app.
### Optionally (if you have time):
User should have an attribute that describes its relationship to other users (think friends)
The profile page shows a list of their friends. Each friend can be clicked on to take the user to that profile.
